# integration-testing

## When to use

Load this skill whenever tasks include:
- authoring or debugging pipeline test fixtures (`.log`/`.json` inputs, `*-expected.json` output, config files)
- setting up or debugging system tests (`_dev/test/system/`, `_dev/deploy/`, mock APIs, 0-hits failures)
- writing script tests for failure paths, API error handling, or package upgrades

## When not to use

Do not use this skill as the primary guide for:
- ingest pipeline processor design and architecture (`ingest-pipelines`)
- CEL program development (`cel-programs`)
- broad elastic-package command selection and stack lifecycle (`elastic-package-cli`)

## Reference files — load the one that matches your test type

| Test type | Load when | Reference file |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Pipeline tests | Writing fixtures, config files, expected output, debugging pipeline test failures | `references/pipeline-testing.md` |
| System tests (generic) | Always load for any system test work — config fields, commands, teardown, debugging | `references/system-testing.md` |
| Script tests | txtar failure/error tests, upgrade tests, mock services embedded in txtar | `references/script-testing.md` |

### System test input-specific references

In addition to the generic `system-testing.md`, load the reference file matching your data stream's input type:

| Input type | Reference file |
|------------|----------------|
| `cel` | `references/system-testing-cel.md` |
| `tcp`, `udp` | `references/system-testing-tcp-udp.md` |
| `http_endpoint` | `references/system-testing-http-endpoint.md` |
| `logfile`, `filestream` | `references/system-testing-logfile.md` |
| `kafka`, `gcp-pubsub` | `references/system-testing-kafka-pubsub.md` |
| `aws-s3`, `gcs`, `azure-blob-storage`, `azure-eventhub` | `references/system-testing-cloud-skip.md` |

When an integration supports multiple input types, load the generic reference plus each applicable input-type reference.

When working across multiple test types in one task (e.g. creating a new data stream end-to-end), load all applicable reference files.

- `references/builder-setup-subagent-guidance.md` — subagent operating manual for wiring data collection (docker-compose, sample logs, agent stream template, system test config, manifest var cleanup) for non-CEL data streams. The orchestrator dispatches subagents by passing this file's **path** in the task prompt; the subagent reads it itself in its own fresh context. Do NOT embed/paste its contents into the task prompt.
- `references/builder-system-test-subagent-guidance.md` — subagent operating manual for running `elastic-package test system --generate` after pipeline work completes (any testable input). Same dispatch rule as above: orchestrators pass the path, the subagent reads the file itself.
